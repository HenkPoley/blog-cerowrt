This data set is also flawed in many respects. 

Usually I investigate behaviors at well below 200Mbits, 
using hardware that is well documented to behave sanely at these speeds.

1Gbit!? Luxury.

It was kind of neat to see BBR settling on around 800Mbit on the 
path - sometimes! - which I thought was due to some offload based
packet loss, where I was able to consistently get a better result
with shaping at 900Mbit.

So I experimented with offloads on and off, shaping on 
and off, and so on. 

It seems like I am capable of getting a decent result at 1Gbit on
the apu2 hardware I'm using for delay/aqm. A bit more work is needed,
and I keep wondering what will happen if I try to shape at closer to 
the line rate.

Other things of note were the BBR behaviors with 16 flows.
