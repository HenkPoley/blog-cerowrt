This data set is pretty flawed.

I was trying to get a box up in the cloud and see how it behaved and
ran into a few problems. In at least one series, I ran the intervening
router out of cpu. In another, I'd setup a faster router behind the
slow one to do the shaping - but there was still traffic on the main
router, uncompensated for.

In most - but not all - of the ecn enabled ones, I
was trying out the ce_threshold = 1ms idea. 

The biggest thing I need to do, is get the stuff in the right places,
AND repeat the other lab tests at the measured RTT here - which was
about 11ms (vs the 8 I used elsewhere).

Which I don't have time for.
