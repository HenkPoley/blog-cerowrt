I reran a string of longer duration tests looking at the 1,2 and 16 flow
issues.

I completely forgot that the download tests have no control over the
remote congestion control algorithm, on the original test run.

I redid a few of the tests, but maybe not all, with cubic configured
manually on the remote server. Anybody else testing against this server
this morning thinking it was doing bbr, got invalid results. Tough.

I think I've finally proven that with a massively overbuffered CMTS (600+ms)
that inbound rate shaping cannot work at short rtts with lots of flows,
at speeds above 100Mbits.

Sigh.
