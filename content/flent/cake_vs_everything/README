Test Notes:

router_setup.sh shows how to use netem effectively on a single interface,
while using sqm-scripts effectively on the other interface, thus correctly
(I hope!) combining delay and aqm into a single box.

test_driver.sh: shows the setup for the range of tests and ips I am using.

Neither are particularly automated at the moment. Flipping bandwidths,
sqm parameters, etc, are done (tediously) by hand.
