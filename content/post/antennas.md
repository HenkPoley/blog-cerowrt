if you want a stick
You've seen this work with Linux?  Because if so I'll order one.
no, but I've never seen one not work... unless they are broken.
I'm going to go do something that doesm't involve lookingg at a computer and feeling like an idiot.
hugging your wife? taking a wander about the yard? stroking a cat?
Probably all of the above.
Actually, the last does fix an iq imbalance - here I am slaving away when all I could use is better sleep, a warm lap, and some catnip.
ok, was fun "helping"
sorry about the ipv6 - you can try enabling the stateless dhcp stuff (man interfaces /ipv6)
you could also try the "borken" card reader in another machine
I just learned of the LEDE fork.  Are you going to rebase CeroWRT on that?
not planning on restarting cerowrt again without funding. Multiple openwrt distributions doing a decent job, I can point you at one if you care.
I plan to finish fixing wifi, and then go live on a beach and wait until the next world crisis needs me.
it's not clear from this blog entry how far we've come, but if you squint at the second plot it is before/after latency and throughput and jitter.

Noted. Which one would you recommend if and when I want to upgrade my N600s?
there are two. wait one.

but I would sit out the chaos the fork may cause unless you have a compelling reason to change.
Some pretty decent new hardware is in the pipeline, but it's still too buggy to recommend...
and seriously... I'd rather spend every ounce of energy I have trying to fix wifi. 3 billion wifi devices with a crappy stack shipped last year. And those stacks affect everybody else using wifi...

and the iot people are shipping horribly bad antennas on their devices not much bigger than a few mm. To save a fraction of a cent on the bom, and because "their" device only needs 6mbits, so why not use up all the air for it?
I LOVE the new "chip". but you have to squint to see the antenna on it. Same goes for nearly all the new wifi integrated boxes like the pi3.
