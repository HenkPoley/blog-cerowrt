The story of the Bufferbloat project is a story of incredible
adversity, failures, and triumphs. I've long though
it would make a great book, where a bunch of Internet greats stepped
up into the saddle again, for one last great adventure, and guided it
all in for a safe landing.

I fear if I don't get started at writing things down, I'll
forget. There are thousands upon thousands of emails to sort through,
as it is, and no doubt I'm missing some important events. I'll gladly
take submissions from others - this is not just my story, but the
story of hundreds of people, over 5 decades, laboring at solving a
problem that has dogged the internet since its inception.

Some of the days that stand out best for me - were the ones one someone totally random, stepped up, out of the blue, to make an important contribution.
