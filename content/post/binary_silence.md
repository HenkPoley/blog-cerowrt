I've had this conversation one too many times over the past few years.
They: "Dave,
we love this stuff, can you talk to us about how to add it into our next chip?" 
Me: "All you have to do is expose a managable interface to the buffering, and
let the higher layers of the stack take care of the rest". :silence:. That
meeting is almost never scheduled.

And: months or years later, I hear about a new proprietary feature
that sounds almost, but not quite like, what we'd discussed, with a new name
and someone claiming it solves everything. I get a chance to test it, and,
it doesn't.

I'm a lazy programmer. I don't have time for marketing special features. You just need to do the engineering in the right place.

This "flat view" to whole-system design is of no help when it comes to
the design and implementation of new features driven by marketing
requirements.

and later, ask if it was a good idea or not.

I'm studiously neutral on binary firmware, but I do sometimes wish that the
dialog over whether to architect something into a chip that is proprietary
or not should be more public than it is.
