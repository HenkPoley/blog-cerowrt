This is a rant about delusional marketeers creating delusional benchmarks that
real engineers and the public are deluded into believing, and an endless
circle of decisionmaking built upon delusion upon delusion. At first glance
what we are talking about in the bufferbloat effort stinks of heresy. Networks ARE getting faster, aren't they?

## We say

* Bufferbloat happens all the time!
* Your benchmark is broken!
* The standards are wrong!
* Your monitoring tool is not measuring the right thing!

Somewhere along here a rational mind starts rejecting new inputs from
someone that must be crazy, that is seemingly coming from outer
space. It helps, to start off with industry wide respect, as Jim
Gettys did all those years ago, and still, even then, he wrote about
the bufferbloat problems for 5 months before someone (me), bothered to
try to reproduce his results, and start seeing just how far down this
particular rabbit hole went.

After fq_codel was developed, in the early days, I had to go, CeroWrt
box in hand, to peoples houses to install it - and I turned many a
doubting thomas into a rabid advocate. These were benefits that were
not only directly measurable, but paid off in vastly improved network
"feel", and QoE.

I (and others in the bufferbloat effort) have spent an extra-ordinary
amount of time - trying to make vendors and ISPs understand that they
are delivering products that could be vastly improved.

## The benchmarks ARE broken

### speedtest

### single flow benchmarks

### Jain's fairness index

## Bufferbloat happens ALL the time

### Wanna believe

## The standards are wrong

## The monitoring tools are busted
