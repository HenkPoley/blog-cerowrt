## The return of taht.net

For years I maintained multiple sites on the internet. After a while, it
seemed less and less relevant, and most of my energies were sucked into
working on [bufferbloat](http://www.bufferbloat.net) and other projects
like [cerowrt](http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki).

Along the way I used things like straight html, org-mode, ikiwiki, and
now I'm trying hugo. 

This is just a skeleton of my return. I'd just like to sit down and WRITE,
and not have to worry about the formatting at all. You know, when you had
an editor that could, like, spell check?

And I am not in need of a blog, per se for taht.net, just all the pointers
it used to have to useful stuff, my music, my family, etc.
