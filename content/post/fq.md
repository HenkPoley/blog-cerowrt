One of my all time favorite papers on fair queuing is: [Evaluating the Number of Active Flows in a Scheduler Realizing Fair Statistical Bandwidth Sharing](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/S_Oueslati/publication/234778751_Evaluating_the_number_of_active_flows_in_a_scheduler_realizing_fair_statistical_bandwidth_sharing/links/5451fab10cf2bf864cbab666.pdf) is one of my all time favorite papers on fair queuing.  The catch - the only catch - is without sufficient multiplexing you end up needing aqm, although the authors propose alternatives that are still worth considering.
