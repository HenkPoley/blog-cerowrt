The ""next generation internet" is already all around us - it just isn't evenly
distributed yet. Technologies already designed, need to be further developed,
and made deployable, and deployed. Vulnerable technologies, need to be patched,
and regularly updated. 

It could use some love.

Permissionless innovation

Open Architectures (such as the risc-v)
microgrants

A definition of insanity is doing the same things over and over
again while expecting a different result.

Fixing bufferbloat and reducing latency

Finish the ipv6 transition

Putting fingers in the dike.

partially deployed new standards

open source code

And ask them what they would do with it.

    Routing scalability at planetary scale
    Uncensorable, untappable Internet infrastructure (Freedombox-ish)
    Routing scalability at city scale among peer nodes (Freedombox-ish)
    A fully distributed database replacement for DNS
    How to crutch along on IPv4 without destroying end-to-end?
    Finishing the IPv6 transition, sanely, and safely.
    DNSSEC as a trustable infrastructure.
    Delivering fiber speeds to ordinary consumers.
    Keeping email relevant while ending its centralized censorship.
    Reliable, secure wireless ad hoc peer to peer radio communication.
    Reliable, working long-haul wireless Internet that isn’t owned by crabbed censorial monopolist cellular companies.
    Restoring “network neutrality” by restoring competition among ISPs.
    Reliable, working, worldwide voice interaction (telephone) replacement.
    Copyright and patent defense/collaboration is another; or perhaps a better way to put it is “how the next Internet can pay creators without throwing away all the advantages of worldwide instant communication”
    Digital value transfer (reliable digital cash)
    Reliable node-level cyber security
    Reliable network-level cyber security
    Reliable internetwork-level cyber security
    Privacy on a large scale network.
    How to leverage information asymmetries for ordinary users’ benefit.
    Distributed social networking.
    Avoidance of pinch-points like Google and Facebook that bend a widely distributed system into an access network that somehow always leads to their monopoly.
    What replaces the Web as the next big obvious thing that we should’ve done years before which takes over the world’s idea of “what the Internet is”?
    Creating better business models than (1) move bits as a commodity, and (2) force ads on people!
