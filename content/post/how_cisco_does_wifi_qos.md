The best wifi I've ever experienced has been at the IETF conferences. Cisco provides enterprise grade APs and professional management there, and until now, I had not found any good documentation on how [Cisco Wifi Qos](http://mrncciew.com/2013/12/23/3850-qos-part-2-queuing-models/) actually works.

Linux gets it very wrong, but I'm out of time to write more on that this week.
