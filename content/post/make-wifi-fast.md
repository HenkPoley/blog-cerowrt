We [laid out everything we could think of to improve wifi last year](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Se36svYE1Uzpppe1HWnEyat_sAGghB3kE285LElJBW4/edit#heading=h.3ankl68j6jjo), and then went hat in hand to try to convince an entire industry we should all work together to solve the problems in wifi,

Why?

```
One WiFi hop is between any company and a large fraction of its users; yet we have paid scant attention to how well WiFi functions, and nearly none at all at how it will continue to scale to the next 300 million hotspots and 10 billion new users and devices in the next 4 years.
```

```
By investing in making WiFi Fast in a way that the whole industry - and all the users! benefit, we can make the Internet a better place, and move the balance between cellular and WiFi technologies...

The return on the investment is very hard to quantify, but also extremely high. Even the lost human time due to bufferbloat is many times the hours spent in engineering; a simple estimate for one second of work time lost per day for one billion users results in 100 person work years (40 hours/week) lost per day.
```

I'm glad we've finally got [a piece of the project](/tags/wifi) off the ground. Since we started writing that document, over 3 billion wifi devices shipped,
all with a stack that could have been made much better.

What I've been doing with [this blog](/post/) is trying to break out 
the individual problems, help solve what I can, and describe how much more
could be done to make wifi better, so that more people, and companies,
can pitch in.
