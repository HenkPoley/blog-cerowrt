My favorite coffee shop in Santa Cruz is the [Pergolesi](http://www.theperg.com). Back in the early 2000s, it was one of the first ones that offered
free wifi. Several people I knew then helped them set that up in
exhange for free coffee - it was a heck of a deal for both parties -
they got more customers - and the
[thirdbreak](http://www.dailywireless.org/2004/05/27/media-burn/) folk
finally broke free of cold loud server rooms in exchange for the great
outdoors, smoking deck, live music and table service. 

Yesterday I went to the Perg to try to get some writing done and had a
chance to run a few flent tests. Their network was finally
bufferbloat-free! I've stayed in touch with the [cruzio ISP](http://cruzio.com) for years,
and I knew the meraki folk are also paying attention to bloat, but to
actually see no bloat, in one of my favorite places in the world -
where the coffee + wifi revolution started - was really wonderful.

Back then, when cliff, elf, sean, tim, and I - and so many others -
used to jump behind the coffee counter to help keep the wifi going,
I'd also felt we were fixing the internet, one coffee shop at a time.

The ripples of all that spread across the world in ways we could
never have imagined.

I was sad to see archive.org didn't [archive the relevant pages](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.thirdbreak.org/hotspots.html), or the mailing list. Those were heady days that I wish I could remember better.
