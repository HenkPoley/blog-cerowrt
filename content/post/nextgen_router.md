The original CeroWrt effort was built on a 70 dollar piece of hardware.
Fixes for the whole Internet have been rolling out worldwide ever since.

CeroWrt, as a separate router distro - is currently dead - Bufferbloat project related fixes and improvements tend to go directly upstream  into several distros without us needing to build and distribute our own. This is a good thing -
because [adding fq_codel to wifi](/post/fq_codel_ath10k)- has taken 2+ years of design and architectural work to
even conceptualize,  and work on that has got to take place on higher end
systems that are easier to debug.

It's not every day you can make such a difference on a low budget.
