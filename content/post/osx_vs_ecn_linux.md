ECN: It's the bomb, it's the bee's knees.  and it's not very necessary.

Fixme: take on cheshire's preso.

[osx_vs_ecn_issue]

And experimenters tend to use what is around the lab and easy to
configure, tends to use linux rather than windows or osx. As we are
trying to deploy this csort of code to all the machines on the internet,
NOT testing aagainst windows and linux has struck me as a bad idea.

However - just like all the experimenters - I'm on a low budget, so I
have exactly one OSX box to play with - and while I'm glad you can get
an intel compute stick with windows 10 pre-installed, it only can hook
up via wifi and that's not what we're testing here.

What's wrong with osx?
