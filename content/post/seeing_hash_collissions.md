Single Queue AQM's (red,pie)use randomness to spread out

A flaw of most of the FQ liturature is that for expositional purposes

cake is the first thing I know of

fq-pie also

But it sucks if that person colliding is you

see rrul_50_down with no offloads

dominated by tests done at very low bitrates.

It's quite pretty

You can see the first, second, and third order hash collissions quite
clearly. It's quite pretty.

At this enormous number of flows, cake itself does get a few, but
no third order collissions happen.

a straight aqm drops

Another problem is on flow admittance - admission control

Nagle took the position that every flow is allowed one packet in flight.

The very first version of fq_codel actually did that, but after a bit of
work we decided that having a worst case latency of 1024*MTU was a bad
idea at lower rates, and we decided that the slow queue/fast queue
mechanism was enough to allow for better admission control, so we
changed it.
