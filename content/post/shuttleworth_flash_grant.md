What - where the abiltity to make these essential changes to the
behavior of wifi - would be barred by law. What little independent
development that remains would come to a screeching halt, routers would
be locked in place with

I'd heard rumors of this NPRM but it seemed so non-sensical that I
merely scratched my head in disbelief and focused on fixing the
technology. You can hear me grumbling in the back during the Q&A of
[simon Wunderlich's talk on the forced firmware lockdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7IYnjiKLFc) at [battlemesh](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=battlemesh).

Then I got my first ever locked down Netgear 4300 router. I got *mad*. I
wrote a 3 page rant. And my initial fury spent, and the filing deadline
a month away, I sat on it for a week or two to cut the cuss words out,
even gave into despair for a while, then I showed the basic draft around
to a few people I correspond with infrequently...

And then I watched Vint Cerf, at 5AM in the morning, his time, sign it:

```"Vint Cerf
Co-founder of the Internet"
```

That was kind of inspiring.

## What did I do with the flash grant?

I paid down some credit cards.

It gave me enough "float" to make it to my next paycheck in November. It
was, the difference between begging my mom for a loan or starvation.

And it helped cover my expenses for a meeting with the core FCC folk in person and file an
[ex-parte filing that summed up the accomplishments of the bufferbloat project](http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view;NEWECFSSESSION=ppl0WFLZjy2GpBVtZ7c8MN8psKNV12S6H5ZygkcrCT1F0c62vnCc!-1135238304!-1678543329?id=60001333550)

Did we change the conversation? You betcha!

To eradicate bufferbloat in my lifetime - and for those willing to leap
on the fixes - this year.

Had to be open source, unpatented and thus sharable across as many

We're still running a [savewifi]() campaign,

## Hard Lessons learned

* Sometimes you need to spend money on things other than engineering,
even if you have no money to spare. Had we got more PR in the popular
press for cerowrt after we first shipped a good release, or
* Micro-Grants are *awesome*. A little money, applied at the right
place,
at the right time, can do wonders.

That sometimes you have to buy it. Which ended up costing about twice as
much as I expected. So I was

Corporate sponsorship would be nice.

Activism is not really something I enjoy. I DO enjoy meeting different
sorts of people and trying to understand their points of view, and
expressing mine. Perhaps I will do more at this level, perhaps not,
but at the moment... I'd rather just go make wifi better for all of
linux.
