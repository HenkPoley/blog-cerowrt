I had a chance to rant about how computer "science" was done at SIGCOMM2014,
picking on nearly every paper published there, the methods used, what
was valued as important, and other flaws of the "process". 

[The value of repeatable experiments and negative results](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2014/doc/slides/137.pdf) was great fun to write, and got
a lot of angst off my back.

But nobody has invited me to keynote at an academic conference since.
