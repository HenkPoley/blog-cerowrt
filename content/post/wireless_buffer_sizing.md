"[Wireless Buffer Sizing, Challenges, Solutions, and Opportunities](http://www.shihada.com/publications/Wireless_Buffer_Sizing.pdf)" is a comprehensive list
of the problems wifi faces in scaling to ever greater numbers of stations
and bandwidths. Extremely good background reading for the problems we are
trying to solve in the [make-wifi-fast](http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/make-wifi-fast) effort.
